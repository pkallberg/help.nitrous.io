title: Setting up MySQL with Autoparts
published: true
categories: [databases]
---

### Prerequisites

* Nitrous.IO box with the package manager Autoparts installed. To ensure Autoparts is installed, run the command `parts` within the terminal. Take a look at the [Autoparts guide](/autoparts/) for installation instructions.

### Install MySQL

You can quickly install MySQL using Autoparts. Within the terminal, run the following command to install:

    parts install mysql

### Starting MySQL

To start up MySQL, run the following command:

    parts start mysql

Within the console you can bring up the MySQL prompt with the following command:

    mysql -u root

### Connecting via Rails

By default, sqlite3 will be setup on Rails and will automatically setup as the configuration is. If you want to create a MySQL database using the mysql2 gem, you will first need to add this line to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'mysql2' 

Once this has been added, run the following within the terminal:

    bundle install

Next, ensure that mysql is running with the following command:

    parts start mysql

Here is the configuration necessary to connect to MySQL locally:

In `config/database.yml`:

    development:
      adapter: mysql2
      encoding: utf8
      database: dev-db
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000

    test:
      adapter: mysql2
      encoding: utf8
      database: test-db
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000

    production:
      adapter: mysql2
      encoding: utf8
      database: prod-db
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000
